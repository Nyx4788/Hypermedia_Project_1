Project Analysis:
The final user of the page, it is the member of the human resources that is going to see my page for obtaining general information about me. With that in mind, the recruiter will want to see information about me, my studies and work experience. Furthermore, I create the page as formal as I can to get an impression of that I am a serious worker.

The information architecture it is very simple. I just divided the whole page into four big frames, one for each important section: one for the header, one for the About Me section, one for the Experience section and one for the Formation section.
Then each big section has subsections which are dedicated to contain the information.

The visual design is also very simple. I used a letter font similar to Times New Roman for being formal, and I used a dark blue similar to the CV I have in real life just to emphasize the titles of each section. 

Diferences beetwen Figma and Html: the navigation bar works in th html so if you click "Formation" you will go on the formation part of the page. Also on the Experience section the titles are linked to the correspondent pag, so if you click on "Spar - Besalú" you will go to the spar webpage.
